# building-energy-nyc
A study on building energy consumption in NYC. Research was conducted on datasets about the topic using Indiana University Libraryâ€™s databases of scientific journals and Google Scholar. The research was summarized in a detailed Literature Review. A related dataset from Kaggle was chosen to perform this study. Zip codes and use types were generated for the partial addresses using the geopy library in Python. A two-sample t-test was performed, which showed no difference in the means of building energy scores between residential and commercial buildings. However, the data may have been skewed since only approximately 20% of the dataset was classifed as residential. 
Building energy scores were predicted using Linear Regression, XGBoost, and SVR models. Models were evaluated based on Mean Square Error and R-squared. The 80/20 split of training and test data using Linear Regression performed best with a MSE of 20.8 and an R-squared of approximately 0.95. However, reproducing the results was difficult even after seeding the random number generator. In the future, cross validation will be used to determine the best model.
